# Player Overview
The Tinkr Player project is a collaborative effort between [Digital Impact Square](https://www.digitalimpactsquare.com/) (DISQ), a TCS Foundation Initiative, and [Curious Learning](https://curiouslearning.org), under the support of the MIT Media Lab.

The effort saw the development of an open-source Unity application, the Tinkr Book Player, as well as an open standard for Tinkr Books, a new type of educational childrenâ€™s interactive, and 5 Tinkr Books.

This app repo consists of 4 main parts:

1. The Shelf-- where a reader selects a book to read.
2. The Reader-- where books are read and interacted with.
3. Data collection-- where usage data is collected and sent to Firebase Analytics.
4. The Tinkr Books-- the book files themselves.

## Shelf

 Including a list of what scripts and files are used in creating the Shelf and how those interact.

#### Files Used:
1. Shelf Scripts <br>
Path: TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Scripts <br>

Script Name | Description | Attached to which game object 
--- | --- | ---
ShelfManager.cs | Main contoller script of shelf and contains all functions performed in shelf  | Canvas
BookObject.cs | Its a book object class for book.cs | Every child of books_wheel game object
BookCollision.cs | It extends shelf manager and uses colliders to detect position of books in shelf | Every child of books_wheel game object

2. Shelf Images <br>
Path: TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Resources\Thumbnail

#### Interaction:
```javascript 
ShelfManager.cs -> BookObject.cs -> BookCollision.cs

 1. Load initial/local asset bundle on shelf scene
 
 // TODO: Pull manifest and book files from a server. Today they are stored locally.
 2. Call server manifest file with timeout of 1.0sec.

 3. if (server manifest is newer than local manifest) 
         use server manifest         
    else
         use local manifest
     
 4.  LoadShelfData();
     LoadInitialCenterBook();
       
 5. if( clicked on Image || Title || center book)
        it ll load scene asynchronusly from "Books/Decodable/CatTale/Common/Scenes/Scene01"
 6. if (clicked on any other book other than center)
        rotate the books clockwise/anticlockwise

 ```

## Creating a New Tinkr Book
Section for "Creating a New Tinkr Book" to detail what needs to be done in creating a new Tinkr Book
### Recipe to make Tinkrbook 


##### 1. Setting the folder hierarchy right. 
StepNo | Description | How
--- | --- |---
1.1|Create a folder at this path with title of the book example "xyzTale" | Path:TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Books\Decodable
1.2|Create 6 folders at this path with level-wise-name of the book example "xyzTaleLevel0"..and soon.|Path:TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Books\Decodable\xyzTale\
1.3|Create a folder with name "Common" at the following path(it refers to common assets and ll contain 5 subfolders)|Common/AnimPNGs; Common/Audio; Common/Images; Common/Scenes 

##### 2. Creating book specific json and other scripts
Step No | Description | How
--- | --- |---
1.|Creating Book specific JSON| Refer any book json at this path "TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Books\Decodable\CatTale\catstorylevel2\Resources" and modify values at R.H.S according to proper value,positioning ,timing, scaling of game object and add corresponding script to it as needed.
2.|Updating manifest|Fill in new book details in shelf manifest at this path: TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Resources\Manifests  
3.|books assets path|TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Books\Decodable\xyzTale\xyzTalelevelx
4.|shelf assets path|TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Resources\Thumbnail

#### What led to specific scripts creation
Also detailing what functionality to date has required the creation of separate scripts rather than what is included in the collection of interactive functions.

Scene No |Script Name |Description 
--- | --- |---
3|LX PQRTale SManager3|
7|LX PQRTale SManager7|
9|LX PQRTale SManager9| 
10|LX PQRTale SManager10|
16|LX PQRTale SManager16|
18|LX PQRTale SManager18|

## Data Collection
#### Files Used:
Script Name | Description | Path
--- | --- |---
FirebaseHelper.cs| Script responsible for logging events to firebase. | TinkrTeam\TinkrShelf\Assets\Scripts\Data\

#### Functions Used:
Functions Name | Description 
--- | --- |
AddBook |Assigns the value of book id to appID.
AddSection | Assigns the value of page number to secID.
LogInAppSection | Logs IN_APP_SECTION event to firebase. IN_APP_SECTION depicts time spent on a particular page.
LogInShelfSection | Logs IN_APP_SECTION event for shelf to firebase(special functions because shelf doesnot have section id!!!).
